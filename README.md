## 💻 Usage

### Lock a Folder

1. Click **"Lock Folder"** button
2. Browse to folder you want to protect
3. Enter a strong password (twice)
4. Click **"Lock"**
5. Wait for encryption to complete

**Result:** All files encrypted with `.locked` extension

### Unlock a Folder

1. Select folder from the list
2. Click **"Unlock"** button
3. Enter your password
4. Wait for decryption

**Result:** Files restored to original state

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS

### 🚨 NEVER FORGET YOUR PASSWORD

**If you forget your password, your files CANNOT be recovered.**

This is by design for security. There is no password recovery, no backdoor, no way to decrypt without the correct password.

### 🚨 BACKUP FIRST

Always backup important files before locking them for the first time.

### 🚨 TEST IMMEDIATELY

After locking a folder, **immediately unlock it** to verify your password works.

### 🚨 WRITE IT DOWN

Store your password in a safe place:
- Password manager
- Secure note
- Physical safe

**DO NOT** rely on memory alone for critical files.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Administrator Privileges Required"

**Problem:** Application won't start or shows privilege error

**Solution:** Right-click `FolderLockApp.AllInOne.exe` and select "Run as administrator"

### "Code Integrity Verification Failed"

**Problem:** Security warning on startup

**Solution:** 
- Normal for debug builds
- For production, sign the executable with a code signing certificate
- In development, this warning can be ignored

### Can't Unlock - Wrong Password

**Problem:** Entered password doesn't work

**Solution:**
- Try again (check Caps Lock)
- If truly forgotten, files **cannot be recovered**
- Restore from backup if available

### Application Crashes on Startup

**Problem:** Application closes immediately

**Solution:**
1. Check logs: `%ProgramData%\FolderLockApp\Logs\`
2. Ensure .NET 8.0 runtime is available (should be included)
3. Run as administrator
4. Check Windows Event Viewer for errors

### Slow Encryption/Decryption

**Problem:** Taking too long to lock/unlock

**Normal for:**
- Large folders (many GB)
- Many small files
- Slow storage (HDD vs SSD)

**Tips:**
- Close other applications
- Ensure adequate free disk space
- Use SSD for better performance

## 📊 Performance

Typical performance on modern hardware:

| File Type | Speed |
|-----------|-------|
| Small files (< 1MB) | ~100 files/second |
| Medium files (1-10MB) | ~10 files/second |
| Large files (> 100MB) | ~50 MB/second |

**Factors affecting performance:**
- CPU speed
- Storage type (SSD vs HDD)
- File count
- Total size
- System load

## 🔒 Best Practices

### Password Security

✅ **DO:**
- Use strong passwords (12+ characters)
- Mix letters, numbers, symbols
- Use unique passwords per folder
- Store in password manager
- Write down for critical files

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use simple passwords
- Reuse passwords
- Share passwords
- Rely only on memory

### File Management

✅ **DO:**
- Backup before locking
- Test unlock immediately
- Keep backups of encrypted folders
- Document which folders are locked

❌ **DON'T:**
- Lock without backup
- Forget to test unlock
- Manually modify .locked files
- Delete database without unlocking

### Usage Tips

1. **Start Small:** Test with non-critical files first
2. **Verify Password:** Unlock immediately after locking
3. **Regular Backups:** Backup encrypted folders regularly
4. **Document Passwords:** Keep secure password records
5. **Monitor Logs:** Check logs for errors

## 📝 How It Works

### Locking Process

1. User selects folder and enters password
2. Application generates encryption key from password (PBKDF2)
3. Each file is encrypted with AES-256
4. Files renamed with `.locked` extension
5. Folder registered in database
6. Original files securely deleted

### Unlocking Process

1. User selects folder and enters password
2. Application derives key from password
3. Each `.locked` file is decrypted
4. Original filenames restored
5. Database updated
6. Encrypted files deleted

### File Structure

**Before Locking:**
```
MyFolder/
├── document.txt
├── image.jpg
└── data.xlsx
```

**After Locking:**
```
MyFolder/
├── document.txt.locked
├── image.jpg.locked
└── data.xlsx.locked
```
